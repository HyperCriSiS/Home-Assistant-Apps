# 0.1.0

- Introduce Calibre AIO with Shelfmark discovery/downloads and CWA library
  management in a shared Home Assistant ingress interface.
- Carry forward automatic HA roles, separate reader identities and the
  Supervisor options permission fix from the CWA SSO feature branch.
- Use independent Python environments and private state for each application.
- Stage downloads separately and deliver completed ebooks to CWA's ingest path.
- Pin upstream source commits/checksums in one manifest and add automated
  update proposals, adapter tests, architecture builds and container probes.
- Initial core Shelfmark image; browser-challenge sources use an optional
  external bypass service. Real provider credentials and live HAOS testing
  remain operator-side acceptance steps.
